<!--Requirements:
You will create a three (3) page web site incorporating what you have learned
about HTML 5 this week. The focus of the site should be about you. Think of this
as a biography that will grow into a larger project, a portfolio (term project). Your
site can have an alternate topic/focus if approved in advance by your facilitator.
Here are the specific requirements:
1. You must have at least two (2) paragraphs of text based content on at
least one page.
a. Full paragraphs are 4-5 sentences in length.
2. You must provide at least one (1) external hyperlink to a publicly hosted
website(s) on at least one page.
a. You can choose to link to your work, your home town, hobbies,
interests, etc.
3. You must use the new HTML5 structural elements on every page.
a. You can use the same image on every page, but if you do, that will
only count as having one image on one page. Add an additional
image(s) to the other pages to meet the requirement.
7. Create a consistent menu/navigation bar that is used on all pages and
contain links to the other pages.
b. You may use a list for navigational/menu purposes. The list could
then be styled with CSS as part of next weekâ€™s assignment.
a. You are encouraged to use HTML 5 video/audio elements, but you
can alternatively embed a YouTube video if you desire.-->
